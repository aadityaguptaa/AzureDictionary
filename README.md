There's a feature on the Google PlayBook app where, while reading an eBook, you can directly tap on a word, and a sheet appears up from the bottom containing the definition of the word. It is quite a useful feature if you are new in the vocabulary game. But, If you are reading a book physically, it might be a tedious process to google every time you find a new word. Drawing inspiration from the same, I decided to make an app that makes the process easier.

In this App, the user can capture an image and then directly tap on the word they want to know about.

The app uses:
Azure's Computer Vision to detect text and
Oxford Dictionaries API
